# week8Assignment

Assignment was to add CSS to the website I created last week. For websites, I beleive that less is more, so I tried to keep my website as clear,
clean, and concise as possible. If you run the 3 html files as well as the css, everything should run smoothly. Also in the repo is the assignment rubric.
