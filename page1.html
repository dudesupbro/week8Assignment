    <p>The Dearborn river is a smaller mountain stream in central Montana. It begins in the Scapegoat Wilderness, and becomes the full river at the confluence with the North and South forks. <br>
        Along the headwaters, it is known for extremely cold water, deep pools, and beautiful secluded canyons. <br>
        Locals enjoy hiking Devils Glen, which follows the Dearborn through these canyons and provides breathtaking scenery. <br>
        Further downstream, the river becomes floatable in rafts, canoes, and kayaks during high water. <br>
