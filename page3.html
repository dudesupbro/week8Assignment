    <p>Fishing the Dearborn is a fickle bitch. <br>
        As stated on Streamflow, the river is only floatable for a very small part of the summer. <br>
        During these times, water may be too high for good fishing. <br>
        However, during lower flowes, one may fish any of the deep pools, riffle patterns, side foam, or deep channels abutting rocks. <br>
        Spinning rods work great with just about any lure: panther martin spinners, rapallas, or normal red and white patterns. <br>
        Flies include streamers, Bitch Creek special, Mayflies, and most importantly, whatever is hatching that day! <br>
        Talk to some locals in Cascade or Craig and they will let you know which hatch to mimic. <br>
